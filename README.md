moQ web chat
==============

What is it for?
--------------

moQ is (to be) a web based messaging client where two people can securely send and receive content from their web browser. Content can be embedded like images, sounds, YouTube videos and more. Chat logs are stored on the users' machines.

How do I use it?
--------------

I think that users should enter a passphrase, and if two people enter the same passphrase they are connected to the chat. I don't know if this will be the case after we develop it.

What can it do?
--------------

moQ is for...

- Sharing messages securely from the web browser
- Watching videos and other content together (proposed idea)
- Sharing images and sounds embedded into the chat (with lightbox functionality)
- It could be used for group chat rooms (proposed idea)
